## Feminism
Feminism recognized ‘women’ as being oppressed and has advocated for equal rights and recognition in all aspects of life. As the concepts of “sex (biology)” and “gender (social)” were deconstructed, feminists asked ‘new’ questions about how the social and natural world are constructed in ways that perpetuate systems of oppression and subordination. Feminist contributions can help us rethink the ideologies and assumptions embedded in bioDesign.

One contribution questions the assumptions inherent in knowledge production. Most societies have produced knowledge from androcentric[^7] points of view deemed as ‘natural’ and ‘universal’ at the expense of subjugating standpoints from ‘others’[^8]. Feminists recognize knowledge can never be ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’, it is situated in history, ideology, social location; it is always partial. Feminists begin inquiry from neglected perspectives to ‘see’ the assumptions made by the dominant paradigm and generate new knowledge (2,3).

Second contribution. Feminists highlight how androcentric societies value ‘masculinity’ as superior to ‘femininity’ resulting in patriarchal hierarchies. These hierarchies are based on dichotomies; breadwinner/nurturer, rational/emotional, and active/ passive. These dualisms are genderized as systems of domination and subordination, which extend to other bodies, spaces, and concepts: such as: mind/body, human/animal, culture/nature, and so on[^9]. Feminists challange and transgress these binaries by creating hybrids (natureculture) and assemblages that reflect their entanglements. By subverting these ‘polarities’, the asymmetrical relation between them blurs and breaks, unfolding new knowledge, practices, and futures (4,5).

Feminists are committed to ‘seeing the unseen’ and ‘caring for the neglected’. As we (re)think the worlds that we embed in our bioDesigns and (re)imagine the bioFutures that we want to inhabit, feminism can help us see how sustainability and care is embedded in bioDesign. By using bioMatter in bioDesign we need to ‘care’ for it because it is essential to its biological and social existence. Caring is an affect, a practice, and an ethic (6). But care has also consequences for knolwedge production: caring requires ‘knowing more’ about what you are caring for (7).
With feminisim, we can “think with care” (6) using situated knowledge and assemblages to help us (re)consider “what [are we] really caring for, why, and at what cost to
whom?” (8).

[^8]: Othering is the process of classifying people into “us” and “them”. This divide can reinforce and reproduce structures of domination.
