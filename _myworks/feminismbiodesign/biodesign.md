bioDesign[^1] is design with biology. It is capable of envisioning (future) applications of bio(techno)logy. In bioDesign we design bioEntities[^2] and design with them; designing their properties, behaviors, and functions[^3]. But how do we design with biology? What is design?

Design has been defined in many ways, often as a discipline, a process, or an artefact. I focus on design as the (re)conceptualizations and the making of “new” things. Designs reflect our ideas and intents of how people (should) think and behave and how things should be and for what purpose. Designed artefacts are informed by and intervene in the world. They are influenced by culture, politics, and identity[^4]. Our design choices can reproduce or disrupt paradigms in our society. When we design we envision and materialize different realities, alternative worlds, possible futures. Critical approaches to design[^5] visibilize the ideologies and assumptions embedded in designed objects, in order to make more informed design choices.

So we ask: What worlds and futures do we make with bioDesign? Will we reproduce the designed worlds of extraction and waste of the Anthropocene[^6]? Or will our bioDesigns be

One of the tenants of bioDesign is that concepts such as sustainability will be embedded in bioDesigned artefacts because bioDesign incorporates an ‘ecological’ perspective that recognizes diversity, interdependancy, vulnerability, adaptability, and recyclability (1). Unlike other matter, bioMatter is part of sustainable systems. The bioMatter we use in bioDesigns requires care to maintain it and keep it healthy. Whether it is our bodies, foods, clothes, shelters, neglect disrupts these systems and others they connect to.
The concepts of ‘neglect’ and ‘care’ have been well studied and developed by feminists. So we turn to feminist theories to rethink the worlds that make and the futures that can be made with bioDesign.

[^1]: bioDesign follows “bio[X]”. See bookmark for an incomplete list.
[^2]: bioEntities can include bioBeings (humans, bacteria, dandelions), bioComponents (genes, muscles, metabolic pathways), or bioMaterials (silk, wood, milk).
[^3]: Respective examples include to: modify the DNA of apples for draught resistance, train dogs to sense glucose levels in diabetics, and use trees as support pillars for constructions.
centered on sustainability? Can bioDesign promote an ethic that cares for humans, non- humans, and the environment?
[^4]: Like, gender, ethnicity, race, class, age, ability, religion, sexuality, and geography.
[^5]: Approaches like Values in Design, Critical Design, Reflective Design, Critical Engineering, Tactical Media, etc
[^6]: The Anthropocene is the current geological time characterized by the alteration of earth systems by human activity (atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biospheric).
