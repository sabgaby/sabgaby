As explained in the Error: Reference source not found I intend to direct attention into the construction of the collective identity, the “we” of the DIYbio movement. To research how participants describe themselves and the practices of the movement, qualitative methods are the most appropriate for tracing processes of meaning-making within the context of a particular community (Krauss, 2005). In the study of social movements semi-structured interviews in combination with participant observation can provide insight into the individual and collective visions, imagining, hopes, expectations, and critiques of their social world and how the movement fits into it [^25].


### 3.1 Data Collection
Participant observation was carried out in movement areas with the purpose to immerse myself into the practices and discourses elaborated there. The research was done online mainly through direct observation of discussions in the DIYbio mailing list and other social networking sites such as Facebook groups, and offline in a biohackerspace with direct participation in a workshop and in a safety training course.

The interviews were done in a semi-structured manner that involved an interview guide (see Appendix D). The guide was designed with the intent to develop insight into the different meanings and perceptions of the DIYbio movement by those who identify themselves as members. The questions were meant to encourage informants to elaborate their responses and were given the freedom to bring new topics into the conversation they considered relevant. Interviewees self-selected themselves to participate in the interviews based on my inquiry in the biohackerspace I attended to and from a social networking site related to DIYbio which I will keep confidential to keep the anonymity of my informants. A total of seven interviews were performed throughout the course of the study through face-to-face interactions or video chat. Informants were selected based on their active engagement to DIYbio groups from different regions; three from Western Europe, two from Latin America and two from Southeast Asia. A comparative table on demographics and on the stats of the interviews can be found in Appendix E. DIYbio members from North America did not self-select themselves for interviews[^26], fortunately their voice is one of the most prominent discourses of DIYbio—as the movement originally started in the US— and is widely available online and accessible to English-speakers. Therefore I focused on obtaining a broader range of meanings from different cultures that have joined the movement. Interviews provided an insiders perspective on the DIYbio movement, to compare I also collected documentary sources from popular media outlets as to get an outsiders perspective. My documentary sources were obtained based on a Google Search with the quoted words “DIYbio” and “movement”. Some of the results from this query are listed in the number 1 footnote in page 2 of this thesis. The articles selected chosen were two daily newspapers: The Guardian and The New York Times; one academic journal: Nature; and four magazines that focus on various topics such as business, life sciences, technology, and popular culture: Forbes, The Scientist, Wired, and Vice respectively. A comparative table on publisher and article info can be found in Appendix B.


### 3.2 Data Analysis
The analysis of documentary sources and interviews implies regarding language as data and discourse analysis is concerned with the expression of language as a way to transmit knowledge to create meaning. Discourse analysis can provide rich data on the comprehension of the movement from an outsiders (articles) and from an insiders perspective (interviews), and to intentions, feelings and purposes that actors give to the movement. The articles were analyzed and relevant snippets concerning my research questions were taken verbatim or summarized and aggregated in Appendix C. The recorded audio from the interviews was transcribed manually with a specialized software (see Credits & Attributions) and the interviews from the Latin American region were translated from Spanish to English by me (a native bilingual Mexican-American). Literal sections were then selected and some are presented as quotes in the text and the rest are aggregated in Appendix E.


### 3.3 Limitations and Considerations
It is important to establish a rapport with the informants so that they feel comfortable and can adjust their discourse to the context. In the interview I first introduced myself and noted that I have a background in engineering and biotechnology as to establish a common jargon. Interviews involve the disclosure of thoughts and feelings of individuals which are considered private. Issues of confidentiality and anonymity were assessed and discussed with informants before and after the interviews were done
and permission was granted orally from the informants to record the audio of the interview for transcription. After the analysis was complete and a rough draft of this thesis was edited, a copy was provided to the informants for them to review the interpretation (and translation if applicable) of their personal thoughts to reduce interpretive authority on my behalf. A final consent form for permission was obtained from them to be able to use the material.

Semi-structured interviews can reduce compatibility between interviews but it allows for interviewees to develop their own coherence which is valuable in itself (Patton, 2002). Also, working in a small-scale research implies that the research is not representative but instead it can provide a rich glimpse into the ethos and diversity of the movement.

[^25]: For a review of the implications and usefulness of semi-structured interviews in social movements, refer
to Semi-Structured Interviewing in Social Movements (2002) by Kathleen Blee and Verta Taylor.

[^26]: This could be due to a wrong assumption of the diversity of nationalities in the social networking site
where I asked for volunteer participation.
