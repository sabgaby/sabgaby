<p><em>
I am currently living in Switzerland doing a PhD in Science and Technology Studies at the University of Geneva.
I am part of a research team rethinking Science and Public Participation; that is practices that are best known as "citizen science".
My research focus is on Do-it-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) and Biohacking, particurly on Pharmaceutical Innovation.
</em></p>
<p>
This is me as Gabriela the scientist.
My <em>Curriculum Vitae</em> (see below) shows my "productive" lifecourse.
But with it I also share a <em>Mini Biography</em>, where I mostly describe the thoughts and choices that led me through my professional life.
</p>

</p>

<h2 class="ui header">Mini Biography</h2>
<p>
I was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico.
I consider myself bicultural but I identify as Mexican as it is my family's cultural heritage and the place I grew up in.
</p>

<p>
For most of my childhood I had very diverse carreer aspirations.
The ones I took most seriously were design and medicine.
During high school I dismissed design as a viable choice (I just don't have the talent), and although I took the exam for medicine school, the decade long training in skills I did not wish for (I wanted to be a psychiatrist, was not interested in surgery for example) dissuaded me.
Eventually someone suggested to me engineering, and 'click', it just made sense somehow.
</p>

<p>
For my bachelor studies I decided to study engineering, and to fulfill my previous desire to study medicine I wanted to mix engineering with biology.
So I ended up with a <em>BSc in Food Science and Engineering</em> from ITESO—a wonderful thing to study if you want your lab courses to involve distilling tequila and not hexane as was the case for the chemical engineers.
I loved the engineering part, but my favorite lab was microbiology.
The whole controversy of genetically modified food sparked my curiosity to know more about the science of it, so I set up to pursue graduate studies.
</p>
<p>
I knew I wanted to study genetic engineering and microorganisms, not plants, or animal tissue, but microorganisms.
Eventually, I found the perfect program in the Netherlands at TU Delft where I did my <em>MSc in Life Science and Technology</em>, specializing in the track of <em>Cell Factory</em>.
Almost all the content was totally new for me which was very challenging, except for the course of <em>Ethical, Legal, and Societal Issues in Biotechnology</em> because, as a surprise to me, I understood the issues from a different perspective than my engineer collegues.
I discovered that my leisure readings on the philosophy, history, and sociology of science had germinated in me the thinking of a social scientist.
Before I knew it, I was hooked and I wanted to learn more.
</p>
<p>
To further my intentions on seriously learning more about the social world of the life sciences I got the support of the <em>Biotechnology and Society</em> Research Group at TU Delft to learn how to do social research.
After my initial proposal on researching technology transfer in the life sciences, I stumbled on the concept of "open source biotechnology", it intrigued me immediately.
Before long, I came across with <em>Biohacking</em> and <em>DIYbio</em>.
Needless to say it became my main research topic which culminated in my MSc dissertation: "We are Biohackers: Exploring the Collective Identity of the DIYbio Movement".
</p>
<p>
In 2015 I was fortunate to join as a PhD student an amazing research team at the University of Geneva to study "The Rise of Citizen Science: Rethinking Science and Public Participation".
My contribution to the team is to focus on <em>Making</em> practices, particularly on the DIYbio movement on which I have been developing expertise.
