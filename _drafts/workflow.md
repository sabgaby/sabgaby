There are many blog posts out there about academic workflows. I know, because I have read _a lot_ of them! I have tried countless softwares, some hits and some huge misses. I dare not admit the amount of chump change I have spent on figuring a sensible way for me to work. And I lament the bugs and crashes and misuse of some software that caused me to lose some of my work (soft sigh). The fact is there is no silver bullet; there can't be one software that does it all. But I think I may have found a good workflow. So here is my two cents. But before! I feel I must declare that I am no way associated with these softwares; it should go without saying, but just in case.

## File Management - DevonThink & Finder Tags
The best feature to manage my files across softwares is to use _Finder Tags_. My work files are stored in Dropbox. These folders are indexed by DevonThink.

I edit the PDF properties on Devonthink (author, title, and subject->publisher), as well as editing the date of creation. I use this script to rename them.

## Reading - Highlights
This way I can sort through these files. I read my files on the Highlights app. Where I have categorized my highlights as Summary, Thoughtfull, Follow-Up, Definition, Quote, Important, Example, Abstract. The notes are saved on the same folder and are therefore indexed by Devonthink as well. I tag those I am reading, and highlighted.

## Writing - Scrivener/Byword + Marked 2 + CriticMarkup
IMHO, the best software I have is by far Scrivener. It just works wonders with the way I work. Being able to separate my writings as much as I can and taking snapshots, helps me . But it gets a bit more complicated than just writing Scrivener. The thing is that I write in MultiMarkDown. Unfortunately Scrivener is more for solo writing. When it comes to having someone give a review, comment, or edit my manuscript, I move my folder to Overleaf, which is a collaborative editing tool.

## Coding - Atom + GitHub Desktop
When I write code I like to use atom.

## Bibliography - Bookends
My team uses Zotero, and for what it is worth I actually used it for my master thesis since I wanted to use all open-source software for it. But I find the UI ugly and it has happened a few times that it crashes on me. I tried as hard as I could to make Papers 3.0 work. After deleting my library, I decided it was a fool's errand all along. I have continued So I am currently using Papers 3.0. I appreciate greatly the fact that I can quickly do citekeys, and the interface is quite nice. I know [Papers was acquired by ReadCube](https://www.readcube.com/press/readcube-papers) early in 2016 and they will be coming up with a new
