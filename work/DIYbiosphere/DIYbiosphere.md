The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to build a library of worldwide DIYbio initiatives. The project is open-source, which means anyone can add and edit entries to the library as well as to shape the overall project. The source files are hosted on GitHub at [DIYbiosphere/sphere], and the library can be accessed and searched through a friendly interface as a wiki-style website at [sphere.diybio.org].

The project was envisioned after we had a discussion in my research group of how we want to share the data we produce and obtain from our Citizen Science research projects. I had started to aggregate data of DIYbio labs and groups on a spreadsheet, which was getting bigger and was proving somewhat cumbersome to hold information such as narrative text.

The project [was proposed] in February of 2016 to the DIYbio.org mailing list.
